### N Queens Problem Solver

This Python script is designed to solve the N Queens problem, a classic problem in combinatorial optimization and computer science. The N Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard in such a way that no two queens attack each other. In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, making it challenging to place them without any conflicts.

#### Code Explanation:

1. **Command-line Argument Handling:**
   - The script checks if the correct number of command-line arguments is provided. It expects one argument, which is the number of queens.
   - If the number of arguments is incorrect or the argument is not a positive integer, it prints an error message and exits.

```python
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: nqueens.py <number of queens>")
    sys.exit(1)
```

```python
try:
    n = int(sys.argv[1])
except ValueError:
    print("<number of queens> must be a positive integer")
    sys.exit(1)
```

2. **Initializing the Chessboard:**
   - The script initializes the chessboard represented as a 2D list (`board`) with dimensions NxN.
   - Each element of the board represents a cell on the chessboard, initially set to 0 to indicate an empty space.

```python
board = []
for i in range(n):
    board.append([0] * n)
```

3. **Solving the N Queens Problem:**
   - The script utilizes a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to the N Queens problem.
   - It iterates through each column of the chessboard, attempting to place a queen in each row of the current column.
   - For each attempted placement, it checks if the queen's position is safe (i.e., it does not threaten any other queens).
   - If a safe position is found, it recursively continues to place queens in subsequent columns.
   - If no safe position is found for the current column, it backtracks to the previous column and tries a different position for the queen.

```python
if not solve(board, 0):
    print("No solution")
```

```python
def solve(board, col):
    if col >= len(board):
        return True
    for row in range(len(board)):
        if is_safe(board, row, col):
            board[row][col] = 1
            if solve(board, col + 1):
                return True
            board[row][col] = 0
    return False
```

4. **Checking Safety of Queen Placement:**
   - The script defines a function `is_safe()` to check whether it's safe to place a queen at a given position on the chessboard.
   - It checks for conflicts in the same row, the upper-left diagonal, and the lower-left diagonal of the current position.

```python
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    for i in range(col):
        if board[row][i] == 1:
            return False
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
    for i, j in zip(range(row, len(board), 1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False
    return True
```

5. **Main Function:**
   - The script contains a main function that executes when the script is run as the main program.
   - It calls the `nqueens()` function to solve the N Queens problem and prints the result.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    nqueens()
```
