# Prime Factorization and Minimum Operations

This Python script provides a method for calculating the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n 'H' characters in the file.

## 1. `minOperations` Method

The `minOperations` method calculates the fewest number of operations needed.

### Method Signature

```python
def minOperations(n):
```

### Initial Checks

```python
if n <= 1:
    return 0
```

If the input `n` is less than or equal to 1, the method returns 0, as no operations are needed.

### Factorization Process

```python
operations = 0
factor = 2

while factor * factor <= n:
    while n % factor == 0:
        operations += factor
        n //= factor
    factor += 1
```

The method iterates through factors, checking for divisibility and accumulating the operations along the way.

### Remaining Factor

```python
if n > 1:
    operations += n
```

If there is a remaining factor, it is added to the total operations.

### Return Value

```python
return operations
```

The method returns the fewest number of operations needed.

## Usage

You can use this method to calculate the fewest number of operations for a given target 'H' characters:

```python
# Example usage
n = 12
result = minOperations(n)
print(f"The fewest number of operations to get {n} 'H' characters is: {result}")
```

This example demonstrates how to use the `minOperations` method to calculate the minimum operations needed for a specific target number of 'H' characters.
