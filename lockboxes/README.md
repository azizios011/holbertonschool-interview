## Unlock All Boxes in Python

This Python script provides a method named `canUnlockAll(boxes)` to determine if all the boxes can be opened.

### 1. Method Definition

The method is defined as follows:

```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """A method that determines if all the boxes can be opened."""
```

This method takes a list of boxes as input and checks if it's possible to unlock all the boxes.

### 2. Iterating through Keys

The method iterates through each key (box number) from 1 to the total number of boxes:

```python
for key in range(1, len(boxes)):
```

### 3. Checking Connectivity

For each key, it checks if there is a way to reach each box using the available keys:

```python
flag = False
for box in range(len(boxes)):
    if key in boxes[box] and box != key:
        flag = True
        break
```

If a box can be reached, it sets the `flag` to `True`.

### 4. Returning Result

If the `flag` remains `False` after iterating through all boxes, it means there is at least one box that cannot be reached, and the method returns `False`:

```python
if not flag:
    return False
```

### 5. Returning True if All Boxes Can be Unlocked

If the method completes the iteration without returning `False`, it means all boxes can be unlocked, and it returns `True`:

```python
return True
```

This method is designed to check the connectivity of keys to boxes and determine if all boxes can be unlocked.
