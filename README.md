## Advanced Binary Search

Directory: `advanced_binary_search`

Contains code for advanced implementations of the binary search algorithm, which efficiently finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

## Heap Insert

Directory: `heap_insert`

Contains code for inserting elements into a heap data structure, ensuring the properties of the heap are maintained.

## Insert in Sorted Linked List

Directory: `insert_in_sorted_linked_list`

Contains code for inserting elements into a sorted linked list, keeping the list in sorted order after insertion.

## Linear Skip

Directory: `linear_skip`

Contains code related to skip lists, a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements.

## Linked List Cycle

Directory: `linked_list_cycle`

Contains code for detecting cycles in linked lists, which can indicate the presence of a loop in the list.

## Linked List Palindrome

Directory: `linked_list_palindrome`

Contains code for checking if a linked list is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forward and backward.

## Lockboxes

Directory: `lockboxes`

Contains a problem involving unlocking boxes with keys. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the goal is to determine if all boxes can be opened.

## Log Parsing

Directory: `log_parsing`

Contains code for parsing log files, which can be used to extract useful information such as error messages, timestamps, and other log data.

## Menger

Directory: `menger`

Contains code related to the Menger sponge, a three-dimensional fractal curve with a high degree of self-similarity.

## Minimum Operations

Directory: `minimum_operations`

Contains code for finding the minimum number of operations required to achieve a certain task, such as transforming one string into another.

## N Queens

Directory: `nqueens`

Contains solutions to the N-Queens problem, where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

## Palindrome Integer

Directory: `palindrome_integer`

Contains code for checking if an integer is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forward and backward.

## Rotate 2D Matrix

Directory: `rotate_2d_matrix`

Contains code for rotating a 2D matrix by 90 degrees, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

## Sandpiles

Directory: `sandpiles`

Contains code related to the sandpile model, a mathematical concept used to study self-organized criticality in dynamic systems.

## Slide Line

Directory: `slide_line`

Contains code for simulating a line sliding in a 2048-like game, merging tiles according to specific rules.

## Sorted Array to AVL

Directory: `sorted_array_to_avl`

Contains code for converting a sorted array into an AVL tree, a self-balancing binary search tree.

## Star Wars API

Directory: `starwars_api`

Contains code for interacting with the Star Wars API, retrieving and displaying information about Star Wars characters.

## UTF-8 Validation

Directory: `utf8_validation`

Contains code for validating UTF-8 encoding in a given text, ensuring that it adheres to the UTF-8 encoding standard.
