## Log Parsing and Statistics

This Python script reads log data from standard input (stdin) line by line, computes metrics, and prints statistics based on the input.

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
```
- This line specifies the path to the Python 3 interpreter.

```python
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
```
- These lines import necessary modules: `sys` for accessing standard input and output, and `defaultdict` from `collections` for creating a dictionary with default values.

```python
def parse_line(line):
```
- This line defines a function named `parse_line`, which takes a single argument, `line`.

```python
    parts = line.split()
```
- This line splits the input line into parts based on whitespace.

```python
    if len(parts) != 10:
        return None
```
- This line checks if the number of parts is not equal to 10. If so, it returns `None`.

```python
    ip_address = parts[0]
    status_code = parts[-2]
    file_size = int(parts[-1])
```
- These lines extract the IP address, status code, and file size from the parts.

```python
    return ip_address, status_code, file_size
```
- This line returns a tuple containing the IP address, status code, and file size.

```python
def print_statistics(total_size, status_counts):
```
- This line defines a function named `print_statistics`, which takes two arguments: `total_size` and `status_counts`.

```python
    print("File size:", total_size)
```
- This line prints the total file size.

```python
    for status_code in sorted(status_counts.keys()):
```
- This line iterates over the sorted keys of the `status_counts` dictionary.

```python
        print(status_code + ":", status_counts[status_code])
```
- This line prints each status code along with its count.

```python
def main():
```
- This line defines the main function of the script.

```python
    total_size = 0
    status_counts = defaultdict(int)
    lines_processed = 0
```
- These lines initialize variables to track the total file size, status code counts, and processed lines.

```python
        for line in sys.stdin:
```
- This line iterates over each line of input from standard input.

```python
            parsed = parse_line(line.strip())
```
- This line parses the input line using the `parse_line` function.

```python
            total_size += parsed[2]
            status_counts[parsed[1]] += 1
            lines_processed += 1
```
- These lines update the total file size, status code counts, and processed lines.

```python
            if lines_processed % 10 == 0:
```
