## Star Wars Characters Script README

This README explains each line of the code in the `0-starwars_characters.js` script.

## Code Explanation

```javascript
#!/usr/bin/node
```
This line indicates that this script is meant to be executed with Node.js.

```javascript
const request = require("request");
```
This line imports the `request` module, which is used for making HTTP requests.

```javascript
const movieId = process.argv[2];
```
This line retrieves the movie ID from the command line arguments. `process.argv` is an array containing the command line arguments, where `process.argv[0]` is the path to Node.js, `process.argv[1]` is the path to the script being run, and subsequent elements are the command line arguments provided by the user.

```javascript
if (!movieId) {
    console.log("Please provide a movie ID as the first argument.");
    process.exit(1);
}
```
This block checks if a movie ID is provided as a command line argument. If not, it logs an error message and exits the script with a non-zero exit code.

```javascript
const URL = `https://swapi-api.hbtn.io/api/films/${movieId}/`;
```
This line constructs the URL for fetching information about the specified movie from the Star Wars API.

```javascript
request(URL, (error, response, body) => {
```
This line makes an HTTP GET request to the specified URL using the `request` module. It takes a callback function as an argument, which will be executed once the request is complete.

```javascript
    if (error) {
        console.error('Error:', error);
    } else if (response.statusCode !== 200) {
        console.error('Unexpected status code:', response.statusCode);
    } else {
```
These lines handle errors and unexpected status codes in the HTTP response. If there is an error or the status code is not 200 (OK), it logs an error message. Otherwise, it proceeds to parse the response body.

```javascript
        const film = JSON.parse(body);
        const charactersUrls = film.characters;
        fetchCharacters(charactersUrls);
    }
});
```
These lines parse the JSON response body into an object (`film`) and extract the URLs of the characters appearing in the movie. Then it calls the `fetchCharacters` function with these URLs.

```javascript
function fetchCharacters(urls) {
```
This line defines the `fetchCharacters` function, which takes an array of character URLs as input.

```javascript
    const promises = urls.map(url => {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            request(url, (error, response, body) => {
                if (error) {
                    reject(error);
                } else if (response.statusCode !== 200) {
                    reject(new Error(`Unexpected status code: ${response.statusCode}`));
                } else {
                    const character = JSON.parse(body);
                    resolve(character.name);
                }
            });
        });
    });
```
These lines create an array of promises, where each promise represents a request to fetch information about a character from their respective URL. The `request` module is used to make these HTTP requests.

```javascript
    Promise.all(promises)
        .then(characters => {
            characters.forEach(character => console.log(character));
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching characters:', error);
        });
}
```
These lines use `Promise.all()` to wait for all the promises in the `promises` array to resolve. Once all promises are resolved, it logs the names of the characters to the console. If any of the promises are rejected (i.e., if there is an error fetching character data), it logs an error message.

```
